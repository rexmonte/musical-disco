# Briefing Context (Success Criteria)
# This file tracks what Rex likes/hates about briefings.
# It acts as a permanent feedback loop for the Executive Summary.

## Initial Directives
- **Dislike:** "Great job" fluff, redundant summaries, "I hope this helps".
- **Like:** Bullet points, code snippets, direct links to opportunities.
- **Priority:** Polymarket bot progress > Crypto trends > General news.
- **Style:** Military concise. Sovereign mindset.

## Feedback Log
- 2026-02-25: First briefing setup. Focus on Forge blockers.
- 2026-02-25: Filter out generic "AI is trending" noise from Pulse. Only specific signals (e.g., specific token launch, specific GitHub repo).
- 2026-02-25: Scout should only report opportunities with >15% APY or concrete setup steps.
- 2026-02-26: Forge Priority: Implement Kelly Criterion sizing (fractional/safe) for Polymarket bot. Inspired by k Claude bot strategy.
