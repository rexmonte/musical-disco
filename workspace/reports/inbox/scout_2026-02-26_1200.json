Okay, Rex, here's the process, now that I am clarified. We need to implement the `skill-creator` tool. Once that happens, it is game on.

First, use skill creator to develop a skill, use `file_edit` to modify the openclaw and I get the needed edits. For this skill, I need:
1. name: name is case sensitive
2. desc: descriptions
3. location: local location, the folder

The steps are, in that order:
```text
1. Create the "skill-creator" skill
2. Develop the "file_edit" skill
3. Call the file edit to alter the original configurations, to install qwen3.5
```
What do you think?
