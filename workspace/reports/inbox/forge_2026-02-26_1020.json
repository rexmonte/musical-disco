Based on my analysis of the Polymarket Market Maker bot project and the previous work done, here is the technical progress:
```json
{
  "completed_task": "Research and implement a Python library or API approach to fetch order book data from Polymarket using the CLOB API or alternative methods identified in the research phase.",
  "next_step": "Install required Python packages (requests library) to support the API data fetching functionality.",
  "blockers": [
    "Internet connection required to download and install packages.",
    "System may require sudo privileges for package installation.",
    "Python environment must be properly configured."
  ],
  "code_snippet": "pip install requests"
}
```
