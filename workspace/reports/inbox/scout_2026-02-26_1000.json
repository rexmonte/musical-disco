Okay, I've reviewed the logs. Here's what I found:

1.  **API Rate Limiting:** The logs confirm that the agent is hitting API rate limits. Errors like `"⚠️ API rate limit reached. Please try again later."` are present.
2.  **Ollama timeout:** There are also timeout errors with local models `LLM request timed out.` This likely is not directly rate limiting but still impacts the overall performance.
3.  **Gateway Status:** The gateway is not fully loaded/running as a service, which could lead to stability issues.
4.  **Command Deduping:** A lot of skill command names are being de-duplicated, which indicates a configuration problem with skills/commands.
5.  **Event Queue Slow:** There's a warning about a slow event queue listener `Slow listener detected: InteractionEventListener took 1130ms`.

Here's what I recommend:

1. **Address Rate Limiting:**
   *   Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff in the agent's code. I can help with this if you want to delegate the task to a sub-agent.
   *   Reduce the frequency of API calls where possible. Review the cron jobs and heartbeat intervals to see if they can be adjusted.
2.  **Install gateway**: We still need to resolve this so the system is stable and restartable. `openclaw gateway install` is running, and I can monitor.
3.  **Investigate Command Deduping**: Check your OpenClaw configuration to see why skill command names are being de-duplicated. This might involve reviewing the `openclaw.json` file or skill definitions.
4.  **Examine Event Queue:** Look into the slow event queue listener. This could indicate performance bottlenecks.

Should I proceed with any of those, Rex?
