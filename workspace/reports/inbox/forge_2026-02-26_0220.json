Based on my analysis of the Polymarket Market Maker bot project and the previous work done, here is the technical progress:
```json
{
  "completed_task": "Implemented Kelly Criterion for position sizing",
  "next_step": "Implement basic spread calculation based on order book depth and volatility estimates.",
  "blockers": [
    "Requires fetching order book data from the Polymarket API (or a suitable alternative).",
    "Volatility estimates need to be sourced (e.g., from historical market data or an external API).",
    "Need to define a clear model for how spread is influenced by these factors."
  ],
  "code_snippet": "def calculate_spread(order_book_depth, volatility):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the spread based on order book depth and volatility.\n\n    Args:\n        order_book_depth (dict): A dictionary representing the order book depth.\n        volatility (float): The estimated volatility of the market.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated spread.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Placeholder implementation - replace with actual logic\n    base_spread = 0.01  # 1% base spread\n\n    # Adjust spread based on order book depth\n    # Example: Deeper order book -> tighter spread\n    if order_book_depth['bids'] > 10 and order_book_depth['asks'] > 10:\n        spread_multiplier = 0.8\n    else:\n        spread_multiplier = 1.2\n\n    # Adjust spread based on volatility\n    spread_adjustment = volatility * 0.1\n\n    spread = base_spread * spread_multiplier + spread_adjustment\n\n    return spread"
}
