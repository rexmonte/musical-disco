I understand. The user wants me to scan for emerging trends in AI, crypto market structure, and biohacking/peptides. I need to look for signals relevant to Rex's interests (Polymarket, sovereign living) and output ONLY a valid JSON object with the keys: 'summary', 'signals' (array), and 'polymarket_alerts' (array). The previous attempt timed out, likely because it was taking too long. I need to be more efficient this time. I will use the search queries from the previous tries and try to synthesize the output more rapidly.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Recall previous searches:** Reuse the successful queries from previous turns: "AI trends 2024 prediction markets AI regulation 2024 impact on DeFi crypto market structure innovations 2024 stablecoin developments 2024 peptide therapy advancements 2024 sovereign living biohacking trends".
2.  **Synthesize signals rapidly:** Immediately extract key signals.
3.  **Structure the JSON:** Construct the JSON object with the required keys.
4.  **Output ONLY JSON:** Ensure the response is ONLY the JSON object.

I will aim for brevity in the descriptions to stay within the time constraints.
