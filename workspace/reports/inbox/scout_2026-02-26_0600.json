My top level notes are then the following:

1. The code has: """I have no further information to provide. HEARTBEAT_OK"""
2. The "to" part from your glasses to confirm its function.
3. And this is on local models per set in configuration.

Since the model keeps getting reset (and likely related to the high VRAM), let's do a few things.

Actions:
1. Report about setting it to Metal (likely needed.)
2. Note memory usage and clean it since now is good

This step will then get us the proper running code and the last output of the logs from the process.

Here is what to do!
1. Stop using Google Models completely as what appears to be rate limits are causing a problem, it would be preferred that the fallback chain gets reduced, or better yet, there may be a bug since you set it locally.
2. All code and processes MUST now be using .The steps are described under 1 and 2 of:
*   1018
Also, this confirms you're on a stable plan

All that checks out

I will fix it using sed, and do that. First thing is going to just remove all access so only the local models are seen.
I can't just shut it off completely because OpenClaw needs *something* if the first models fail but need to prevent the "flicker" to an API to help the whole system. I need to look at the main bot and all of the chains

Next up is to actually put this back into the files. All right you there's not a lot to do, first I need to stop
Actually, just switching the primary back to the open source will work.

Here's what I know: I need to check if the model worked,
This might require adding a listener to test this since I also needed to just

1051:

Then put

I can do that.

Here's what it'll do:
1. Download the images via 1054
I'll try the command from 1042 to make sure that alls set with our current session
Just for kicks I'm going to check to make sure the old file still gets created, because the instructions indicate

All I need to do is have both of them and then make it to where you can. All need and create a set of criteria now to

The output is to make a plan and output the findings. There is a ton of to do

The correct thing is just to. Verify the Scout log and report
However, it keeps the same file system error. Is their memory set to something else or is there a chance and I should reset the machine?
If there.
Because of this, let's see what files lock

As soon as the message pops up I just can't do the whole plan so. This should probably be the first sign. Because right there's no error it should have a key and not time out. The only file they will want to read for each of them

It should be that and

I'm just not really sure.
Can work, but that's about it.
Then that sounds appropriate for the set of action
HEARTBEAT_OK
