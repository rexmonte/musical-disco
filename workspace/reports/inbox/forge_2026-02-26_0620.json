Based on my analysis of the Polymarket Market Maker bot project and the previous work done, here is the technical progress:
Based on the files, the last *successful* step was the spread calculation. So, the next step is to actually *fetch* the order book depth, which is currently a placeholder.
```json
{
  "completed_task": "Implement basic spread calculation based on order book depth and volatility estimates.",
  "next_step": "Research and identify appropriate Python library or API to fetch order book data from Polymarket. If an official Polymarket API exists, prioritize its use. Otherwise, look for community-maintained libraries or consider scraping the data from the Polymarket website as a last resort.",
  "blockers": [
    "Lack of official Polymarket API documentation.",
    "Rate limits on any unofficial APIs or scraping.",
    "Complexity of parsing scraped data if an API is not available."
  ],
  "code_snippet": "# Research and selection of appropriate data source for Polymarket order book data."
}
```
