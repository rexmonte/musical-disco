# Polymarket Alpha Research

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** Initial research phase

## Objective
Identify high-probability arbitrage opportunities on Polymarket, focusing on:
- BTC-related markets (5m/15m chart movements)
- Mispriced odds vs. real probability
- Cross-market arbitrage opportunities

## Current Understanding

### Platform Mechanics
- **Polymarket:** Prediction market where YES/NO shares determine probability
- **Odds = probability perception:** 85% odds means market believes 85% chance of YES
- **Arbitrage exists when:**
  - Correlated markets have inconsistent pricing
  - Market odds diverge from on-chain reality
  - Temporal mispricings (odds adjust too slowly to events)

### Alpha Sources to Explore
1. **BTC price action → Prediction markets**
   - When BTC drops 2% on 5m chart, do "Bitcoin < X" markets underreact?
   - Look for lag between spot price movement and probability adjustment

2. **Correlated market arb**
   - "Bitcoin > $100K by March 1"
   - "Bitcoin > $105K by March 1"
   - If these have inverted or misaligned pricing, there's arb

3. **Funding rate arb**
   - When perpetual funding is extreme, market might be over/underweight on BTC outcomes
   - Example: Heavy long funding → market might overprice "BTC up" events

4. **Event timing arb**
   - Markets settle based on specific oracle feeds (e.g., CoinGecko at UTC midnight)
   - Sometimes price movement post-settlement creates arb windows

## Next Actions
- [ ] Connect to Polymarket API for real odds data (API key ready, just need to implement)
- [ ] Pull historical BTC data + corresponding market prices to identify lag patterns
- [ ] Build monitoring script for cross-market inconsistencies
- [ ] Backtest simple arb strategies on historical data

## Tools Needed
- Polymarket API client (using `POLYMARKET_API_KEY`)
- BTC price tracking (funding rates, liquidations, on-chain)
- Cross-market correlation analysis
