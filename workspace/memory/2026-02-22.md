## 2026-02-22 — Ops Overhaul + Polymarket Bot Research

### Session Startup Issues
- Gemini 3.1 Pro as default was causing session corruption at ~140K+ tokens
- Gemini was also leaking raw JSON metadata into responses (instruction-following failure at high context)
- Fixed: switched default model to `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`
- Gateway had token mismatch after restart — CLI was locked out but gateway was still serving Discord fine

### Twitter/X Bookmarks Setup
- Configured bird CLI with AUTH_TOKEN + CT0 for @Sc0ttTheRobot
- Stored credentials in workspace/.env.bird
- Ran full 50-bookmark digest — heavy focus on Polymarket bots, OpenClaw meta, biohacking, AI economics

### Polymarket Bot Research
- Simple YES+NO arb is dead — Polymarket added dynamic taker fees (peak 1.56% at 50% prob) specifically to kill latency arb
- Viral "buy both sides" bots from Twitter were largely fake/exaggerated P&L
- **What actually works: Market Making**
  - Polymarket added Maker Rebates alongside taker fees — makers earn spread + rebates
  - 5-min and 15-min BTC/ETH/SOL markets are the target: high churn, retail constantly crossing spreads, low MM competition
  - Markets resolve every 5-15 min → fast compounding
  - GitHub: `lorine93s/polymarket-market-maker-bot` is production-ready reference
- Key reference article: "Beyond Simple Arbitrage: 4 Polymarket Strategies Bots Actually Profit From in 2026"

### Cron Agent Fixes
- All 3 agents were erroring because models were set to `ollama/coder-fast`, `ollama/moe-fast`, `ollama/q8-fast` — Ollama not registered as provider
- Fixed all 3 to Claude Haiku/Sonnet
- Forge prompt completely rewritten for Polymarket market-maker bot build
- Scout prompt updated: max 3 searches, no web_fetch on listing sites, graceful rate-limit handling
- Pulse prompt updated: lean 2-search approach, same graceful degradation
- All 3 manually triggered to run

### Open Items
- Rex needs a Polygon wallet + USDC to go live with the Polymarket bot when built
- Brave Search API rate limits still an issue — consider upgrading or adding SerpAPI fallback
- Adult content bookmark from @JackGilber24334 — Rex didn't respond to offer to delete it
- Gateway CLI auth (token mismatch) — Rex needs to run `openclaw gateway stop && openclaw gateway start` from terminal to fully fix
