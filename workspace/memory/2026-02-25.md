- **Chief of Staff Pipeline Finalized**: Agent reports (Scout/Pulse/Forge) now write structured JSON to `reports/inbox/` instead of direct Discord posts. Ace synthesizes all into a single executive summary at 7:00 AM/PM.
- **Usage Audit Log Added**: `reports/usage_audit.csv` logs all model requests as `LOCAL_OLLAMA` (zero API cost). Proof: All agents forcibly set `OLLAMA_HOST="http://127.0.0.1:11434"`.
- **Bookmarks Integrated**: `librarian.sh` scrapes X bookmarks via authenticated `bird CLI`, saving to `reports/inbox/` at 6:30 AM (deduped against `seen_bookmarks.txt`).
- **Verification Confirmed**: `bird` CLI works with `.env.bird` credentials, no API tokens burned. All execution visible in audit log.
- **Feedback Loop Ready**: Run `ops/feedback.sh "Your note"` to refine briefing content (e.g., "Stop citing Solana unless it's a real opportunity").
