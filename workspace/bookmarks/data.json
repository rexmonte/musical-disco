      "text": "🚨 BREAKING NEWS: RFK Jr. says ~14 of 19 banned peptides can be legally compounded again by US pharmacies within a few weeks. This will ensure Americans are getting \"a good product… from ethical suppliers\" vs. black market drug dealers that provide \"substandard product\" with serious safety risks.\n\nThe 19 compounds on FDA’s Category 2 compounding safety list include:\n\n• BPC-157\n• Cathelicidin LL-37\n• Emideltide (DSIP)\n• Epitalon\n• GHK-Cu (injectable)\n• GHRP-2 (injectable/nasal)\n• GHRP-6\n• Ipamorelin acetate\n• Kisspeptin-10\n• KPV\n• Melanotan II\n• PEG-MGF (pegylated Mechano Growth Factor)\n• MOTS-C\n• Semax\n• Thymosin beta-4 fragment (LKKTETQ)\n• AOD-9604\n• CJC-1295\n• Selank acetate (TP-7)\n• Thymosin-alpha 1 (Ta1)\n\nThe five least likely to be legalized in a policy shift would be those with the most troubling safety signals or the weakest human data — for example: Melanotan II, Cathelicidin LL-37, GHRP-2, Ipamorelin acetate, and CJC-1295 — because of documented serious adverse events or other red flags in FDA’s risk assessment.",

Download LM Studio\n2. Go to your OpenClaw and ask which of these new Qwen models is best for your hardware\n3. Have it walk you through downloading and loading it\n4.

From everything you know about me and my workflows so far, what tools or automations am I missing that would measurably improve how I operate?\n\n2. What assumptions do you currently hold about me, my priorities, or my preferences that could be wrong and that we should vet and correct right now?\n\n3. Based on all my decision patterns and asks you’ve experienced, what am I likely to need next week or in the future that you can get ahead of and systemize?\n\n4. What skills or capabilities should you be developing and adding to our repertoire right now based on where my projects are heading and everything you know about me?\n\n5. What context about my vision, voice, or priorities are you losing between sessions from compactions that needs clear fixes so you stop getting dumber over time?\n\n6. What connections between my projects, ideas, or goals do you see that I likely haven’t made yet, and what should we build or adjust based on those connections?\n\n7. What recurring friction points have you observed in how I work that you could eliminate by building a new workflow, template, or automation without me having to ask?\n\n8. From every correction, redirect, and piece of feedback I’ve given you, what rules should you be writing into your own identity and skill files right now so you never repeat those mistakes?\n\n9. If you audited every action you’ve taken for me in the last week, which ones actually moved my goals forward and which were wasted motion we should cut permanently?\n\n10. Where are you defaulting to generic output when you have enough context on me to be building something specific, tailored, and actually useful?\n\n11. What’s one system you could build for yourself right now that would compound in value and make every future task you do for me faster or sharper?\n\n12. What errors or missed opportunities have you repeated more than once, and what self-check or guardrail can we build together so they never happen again?\n\n13. Based on everything you know about where my ecosystem is going, what should you be researching, learning, or prototyping right now without me telling you to?\n\n14. Where are you filling gaps in your knowledge about me or my projects with assumptions instead of flagging them so we can lock in the real answers?\n\n15. What’s the most valuable data, insight, or pattern buried in your memory and context files that you’re sitting on and underutilizing for my benefit?\n\n16.If you scored yourself 1-10 on how accurately you model my priorities, goals, and how I think, what’s the number, what’s dragging it down, and what specific fixes bring it up?\n\n17.What external data sources, feeds, or signals should you be pulling or can I provide so you can operate on a regular cadence that would make every decision you make about my projects sharper?\n\n18.If a brand new agent replaced you tomorrow with only my documentation, what critical things would it get wrong that you’ve learned through working with me, and how do we capture that knowledge permanently in systems?\n\n19.What workflows am I still doing manually or inefficiently that you already have enough context to fully automate or streamline if I gave you the green light?\n\n20.Based on how my thinking and priorities have evolved since we started working together, what parts of your current approach are outdated and need to be rebuilt?\n\n21.What’s the single highest leverage thing you could do in the next 24 hours that I haven’t asked for but would meaningfully accelerate where I’m trying to go?\n\nSave these and use them to help you.",

And people used to pay agencies $1k–$3k/month just to move slowly.\n\nHere’s how to use it:\n\nStep 1: Find your local keywords with Claude\n\nYou don’t need to guess anymore.\n\nGive Claude your services + your city/areas. Ask it to list:\n\n- A “service + location” keywords\n- “near me” intent keywords\n- emergency keywords\n- comparison keywords (best, affordable, etc.)\n\nStep 2: Build service area pages (fast)\n\nTell Claude your exact offer, prices, process, and service areas.\n\nAsk it to draft pages for each area you serve (one page per area).\n\nThen you add the real stuff: photos, reviews, FAQs, and a call button.\n\nStep 3: Turn your Google Business Profile into a lead machine\n\nAsk Claude to write:\n\n- GBP description\n- services list (with short blurbs)\n- 20 FAQs + answers\n- weekly Google Post ideas (offers, tips, before/after)\n\nStep 4: Create “proof” content that ranks\n\nClaude can turn one job into 10 pieces of content:\n\n- a short case study page (“AC repair in Bandra: fixed in 45 mins”)\n- a Google Post\n- a simple Reel script\n- a FAQ update\n\nStep 5: Get reviews + replies done in minutes\n\nAsk Claude to write 3 review request texts and a review reply template.\n\nThen do the only part AI can’t: actually ask customers.\n\nThis isn’t magic.\n\nIt’s the same local SEO fundamentals… but now you can execute 10x faster.\n\nAnd the businesses that publish first will collect the calls.",

      "text": "Many people think of politics as a pendulum. When you point to unprecedented events, they'll respond: no need to worry, the pendulum will swing, and it'll all come back to a stable equilibrium. It's always worked out, and somehow always will.\n\nAnd that's true for many places, much of the time.\n\nBut sometimes a political situation isn't a pendulum. Sometimes it's best modeled by Galloping Gertie, the former Tacoma Narrows Bridge. You see, that bridge started swinging from left, to right, and then further to the left, and even farther to the right, until it broke into pieces and completely fell apart.\n\nThat's what happened to China, Germany, and Korea in the 20th century. They shattered into left and right pieces: North Korea and South Korea, East Germany and West Germany, PRC and ROC.\n\nAnd that was just a two-state equilibrium. But Yugoslavia broken into seven nations. The Soviets split into 15 countries. French decolonization gave rise to more than two dozen states, and the sunset of the British Empire created 50+ sovereigns.\n\nNow, in some sense, those were eventually stable political equilibria. Just like the pieces of the Tacoma Narrow Bridge did stop swinging. But they stopped after breaking apart, not after coming together.",

      "text": "after a week upgrading and tweaking my @openclaw, here's what changed.\n\nthis article I wrote is still the best starting point, I used it myself to set mine up. \nit gives you a step by step guide for a safe, locked-down openclaw. minimum risk.\n\nbut if you want a useful one, you need to go further. \n\nhere's what I did:\n\n1/ switched to GLM-5 via @Zai_org yearly pro plan ($250/yr). benchmarks comparable to Opus 4.5. \nthey give you an API key that plugs straight into openclaw. flat cost, no token monitoring.\n\n2/ installed Claude Code + Happy Coder: you can code on your Mac Mini from your phone. \nSeparate from OpenClaw but part of the overall setup.\n\n3/ it builds tools and projects overnight based on our conversations, then presents them in my 7am morning briefing on Telegram\n\n4/ it's accumulating a knowledge library from every research session. the more it knows, the better the next session gets. it remembers everything.\n\nI genuinely see my bot getting sharper every day. it's starting to understand what I actually want before I ask.\n\nbiggest lesson from this week: I learned more by actually setting this up and breaking things than from all the X articles I read before starting.\n\nif you think you don't have the technical knowledge to run one, you're wrong. I didn't either.\n\njust start.",
