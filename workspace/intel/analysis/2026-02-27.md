# Market Intel — 2026-02-27 (Friday)

## BTC

- **Price:** $66,212 | 24h range: $66,642–$68,116 | **-2.71%**
- **Direction:** Bearish. Sold off through the day, currently near 24h lows. Price broke below the low end of recent range.
- **Funding rate:** Not reported in today's data — monitor manually. Absence of data is itself a gap worth flagging.
- **Portfolio value:** 7.12 BTC × $66,212 = **$471,430**
- **Key levels:**
  - Support: ~$66,000 (psychological + 24h low zone), $62,500 (Polymarket implies 62.5% chance of dipping to $50K by EOY — suggests $55K–$60K is a zone the market respects)
  - Resistance: $68,100 (today's high rejection), $75,000 (Polymarket: 85.5% chance of reaching by EOY)
- **vs Yesterday:** Significant leg down. Yesterday's arb scan showed ATH market at 18% — with price now at $66K, that's tracking. The $110K by EOY market (26.5%) vs ATH market (18%) gap from yesterday's scan persists — still the best arb signal.

## POLYMARKET

**Highest volume (24h from raw data):**
1. **US strikes Iran series** — $25.1M 24h vol / $462M total (geopolitics mega-market)
2. **La Liga Winner (Mallorca)** — $6.8M 24h vol (sports)
3. **US strikes Iran by Feb 28** — $6.2M 24h vol, Yes @ 24% (expires TOMORROW)
4. **Jesus Christ returns before GTA VI** — $20.7K 24h, $9.5M total (meme market, 48.5% Yes — lol)
5. **BTC hits $1M before GTA VI** — $19.3K 24h, $3.4M total

**Potential mispricings:**
- **BTC ATH (18%) vs BTC $110K by EOY (26.5%)** — 8.5pp gap. ATH is ~$109K, so these should be nearly identical. Best signal from yesterday, still live.
- **BTC $150K–$190K range all priced 6.5–7.5%** — flat/stale pricing across $40K of range. Illiquid but exploitable if you can get fills.
- **US strikes Iran by Feb 28 @ 24%** — expires tomorrow. Binary catalyst. If you have an edge on Iran intel, this is the play.

**Arb opportunities (from yesterday's scan, likely still valid):**
- ATH vs $110K cross-event: 8.5pp (MEDIUM confidence)
- $500K vs $1M spread: only 0.2pp gap for $500K range (compressed)
- $200K vs $250K: 0.1pp for $50K gap (compressed)

## MACRO

- **Core PPI m/m** (HIGH impact): Forecast 0.3% vs prev 0.7% — big expected drop. If it comes in hot, BTC sells off further. Cool print = relief rally.
- **PPI m/m** (HIGH impact): Forecast 0.3% vs prev 0.5%
- **Q4 GDP revision**: Weak 1.4% advance estimate + gov shutdown impact. Downward revision = more dovish Fed narrative = BTC bullish medium-term.
- Chicago PMI & Construction Spending: low impact, ignore.

## SIGNAL STRENGTH

**MEDIUM**

Two high-impact inflation prints today (PPI) with BTC already down 2.7% and sitting on support — a hot print could accelerate the selloff, a cool one could trigger a bounce. The Iran market expiring tomorrow adds geopolitical tail risk.
